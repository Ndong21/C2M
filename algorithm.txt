# Task: Develop a coffee machine management (C2M) 

# objective: Develop a Python application that simulates the management of a coffee machine. 
            The program should handle inventory management for coffee, water, milk, and sugar, 
            and prepare beverages according to user requests.

# Description:

Your task is to create a program that manages a coffee machine with the following functionalities:

Inventory Management:

 • The machine must have inventories for coffee, water, milk, and sugar.
 • The initial quantities of each ingredient are set at the start of the program.

Beverage Preparation:

 • The machine should be able to prepare the following beverages:
 • Espresso: requires 50 ml of water and 20 g of coffee.
 • Café au lait: requires 30 ml of water, 20 g of coffee, and 100 ml of milk.
 • Coffee with sugar: requires 50 ml of water, 20 g of coffee, and 10 g of sugar.
 • Café au lait with sugar: requires 30 ml of water, 20 g of coffee, 100 ml of milk, and 10 g of sugar.

User Interface:

 • The program should offer a command-line interface where the user can select the beverage they wish to prepare.
 • The program must check if the necessary ingredients are available and inform the user if the preparation is possible or not.
 • If preparation is possible, the ingredient quantities should be updated accordingly.

Inventory Display:

 • The program should allow the user to check the current state of ingredient stocks.

Error Handling:

 • The program must handle cases where ingredients are insufficient to prepare the requested beverage and display an appropriate message.

 Algorithm:

 1. Define containers to hold quantities of the ingredients water, milk, coffee, sugar
 2. Get initial quantities of each ingredient upon program start
 3. Display the menu of possible drinks that can be prepared (Espresso, cafe au lait, coffee with sugar, cafe au lait with sugar)
 4. Allow user to enter the choice of drink to be prepared
 5. check the inventory based on the choice made by user and inform user if the preparation is possible or not.
 6. if preparation is possible, update the ingredient quantities now left.
 7. if preparation is not possible, display an appropriate message.
 8. ask the user if they will like to view the current inventory of stocks
 9. if they say yes to 8, display the available stocks
 10. if they say no, display the text "ok, thank you".
